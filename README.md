# Background Context

- The 3D_Shooter is a 3D maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world. The game was developed in C using the SDL2 library. Development was performed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

- The Maze is compatible with both Mac OS X and Linux/Ubuntu. It employs ray casting to create the illusion of a 3D environment within the maze.

## About SDL2 üíª

- Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is widely used in video playback software, emulators, and popular games, including Valve's award-winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games. For more information on SDL2, visit the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official SDL2 website</a>.
