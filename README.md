# Background Context

- The 3D_Shooter is a 3D maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world. The game was developed in C using the SDL2 library. Development was performed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

- The Maze is compatible with both Mac OS X and Linux/Ubuntu. It employs ray casting to create the illusion of a 3D environment within the maze.
