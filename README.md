# Background Context

- The 3D_Shooter is a 3D maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world. The game was developed in C using the SDL2 library. Development was performed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

- The Maze is compatible with both Mac OS X and Linux/Ubuntu. It employs ray casting to create the illusion of a 3D environment within the maze.

## About SDL2 üíª

- Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is widely used in video playback software, emulators, and popular games, including Valve's award-winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games. For more information on SDL2, visit the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official SDL2 website</a>.

## Environment

- Language: C

- Library: SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

- Compiler: gcc flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

## Installation

  - Mac OS X or Linux/Ubuntu
  - SDL2 Installation

- If you don't have SDL2 installed, you can download the installation script [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P7mISrn8QofKOYjQ09wASLEHCzghNHnQ/view?usp=sharing). After downloading, locate the script and run it in your terminal:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

## How to play the game

Step 1: Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Brendon45/3D_Shooter.git
```

Step 2: Compile All .c Files

- To compile all .c files in the src directory and generate an executable file called maze, run the following command:

```
make all
```

Step 3: Run the Executable

- To play the game, run the executable with a specified map option.
	- The available map options are `level_1` to `level_7`, and:
		- These are for demonstration:
			- `demo_00 and demo_01`.

Example Commands:

To play the first level, use:

`./maze maps/level_1`

To play the first demo, use:

`./maze maps/demo_00`

## Controls

To play the game, you need to know these controls:

- Left Arrow Key / `F` Key: Rotate camera to the left
- Right Arrow Key / `H` Key: Rotate camera to the right
- `Up Arrow` Key / `T` Key: Move forward

## Future Enhancements

                                   üößThis project is still a work in progress!
üìçThere are still many elements that are under development and we wish to implement them into our 3D_Shooter project.
                               Stay tuned for more updates coming soon. üçøüì∫üçø

- Additional Levels: Plan to introduce more complex and challenging maze levels.

- Enhanced Graphics: Explore advanced graphical techniques to further improve the visual appeal

- Improve Game Experience: By adding other elements such as sprites, enemies, weapons, rain, water, lava, etc. We can improve the difficulty and overall experience with the game.

- Expanded Compatibility: Aim to extend compatibility to more platforms, including Windows.
